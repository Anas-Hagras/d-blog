    "text": "Giving feedback, whether at work or in personal relationships, can be a powerful tool for growth. When those around us thrive, we all benefit. Here\u2019s a quick guide to help you master this skill with ease.\n\n- **Five Key Principles**: Feedback isn't just for subordinates; it can be shared with anyone. Prepare ahead, be empathetic and fact-based, and remember feedback is a gift. Deliver it promptly or schedule it regularly.\n\n- **Feedback Template**: Jot down your thoughts using this simple framework:\n  1. I observed *[specific behavior]*.\n  2. It made me feel *[your reaction]*.\n  3. One idea to improve is *[suggestion]*.\n\n- **Strength Framework**: Use the \"a tea shops\" acronym to think about strengths:\n  - *A*thlete: Prioritizes health and balance\n  - *T*eacher: Mentors and shares knowledge\n  - *E*ngineer: Provides practical solutions\n  - *A*rtist: Embraces creativity\n  - *S*cientist: Bases decisions on data\n  - *H*uman: Shows authentic personality\n  - *O*wner: Takes accountability\n  - *P*ioneer: Leads with courage\n  - *S*tudent: Welcomes growth\n\n- **Real-Life Example**: I once reminded a superior to be more like a scientist by addressing selection bias and ensuring balanced scenario presentations.\n\nRemember, feedback is about empowering others and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Try using these tools and watch the positive impact unfold!",
