"A professional, realistic illustration of a tea shop with nine distinct characters representing the 'A TEA SHOPS' strength framework, where each character is engaged in an activity that symbolizes their respective strength. For instance, the Athlete could be sipping a healthy smoothie, the Teacher could be explaining something to another character, the Engineer could be fixing a piece of machinery, the Artist could be painting a tea cup, the Scientist could be examining tea leaves under a microscope, the Human could be laughing with another character, the Owner could be overseeing the shop with satisfaction, the Pioneer could be ushering in a new tea blend, and the Student could be attentively reading a book on tea varieties. Include speech bubbles over the characters with brief feedback messages that use the 'Observe, Feel, Improve' template from the blog post. Use vibrant but professional colors with a clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the concept of giving constructive feedback to strengthen team dynamics in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."
