**MEDIA PROMPT:**
"A professional, realistic image of a tea shop where different roles (athlete, teacher, engineer, artist, scientist, human, owner, pioneer, student) are represented by individual customers or employees. Each role should be visually identifiable by their activities or props. Include a notepad or chalkboard showcasing the feedback template ('I observed', 'It made me feel', 'One idea to improve is'). Use vibrant but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the importance of diverse roles and effective feedback in a team setting, emphasizing the value of nurturing growth and empowerment in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Optimized for Twitter timeline display with high contrast and bold visual elements, the design should be professional, shareable, and mobile-optimized with a clear focal point that works in thumbnail size."
