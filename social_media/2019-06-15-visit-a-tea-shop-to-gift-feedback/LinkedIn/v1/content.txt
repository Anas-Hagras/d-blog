Feedback is a powerful tool for growth, both professionally and personally. When we invest time in enhancing others' strengths, we inadvertently elevate ourselves. Drawing from consulting experience, I've found a simple yet effective feedback template: observe, express, suggest. This approach ensures feedback is factual, empathetic, and actionable.

Consider the "A Tea Shops" framework for identifying strengths: Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, and Student. Each persona embodies traits that can guide our feedback and development.

How do you ensure your feedback is both constructive and empowering? Share your thoughts or experiences below.
