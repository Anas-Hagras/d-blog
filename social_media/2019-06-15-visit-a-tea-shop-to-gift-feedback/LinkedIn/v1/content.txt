In today's fast-paced world, mastering the art of giving and receiving feedback is a vital skill. Effective feedback is not just a courtesyâ€”it's an investment in collective growth. By preparing thoughtfully and focusing on strengths, we can transform feedback into a catalyst for improvement.

Here's a simple yet powerful template for delivering feedback: 
1. "I observed..."
2. "It made me feel..."
3. "One idea to improve is..."

Additionally, adopting the "A TEA SHOPS" framework can help identify and nurture key strengths, promoting a holistic approach to professional development.
