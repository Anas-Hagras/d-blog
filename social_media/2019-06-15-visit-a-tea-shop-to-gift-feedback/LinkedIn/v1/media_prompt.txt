"A professional, realistic image of a tea shop setting showing various character personas representing the 'A TEA SHOPS' strength framework - Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, Student. Each persona should be engaged in an act that represents their key strengths. Include visual elements that represent the process of giving and receiving feedback, such as speech bubbles or note cards. Use a vibrant yet professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the holistic approach to professional development and the transformative power of effective feedback as outlined in the social media content, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media, especially LinkedIn's professional environment."
