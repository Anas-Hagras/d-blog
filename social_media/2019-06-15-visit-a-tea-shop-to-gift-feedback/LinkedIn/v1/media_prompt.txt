"A professional, realistic image of a modern tea shop setting with diverse individuals engaged in thoughtful conversation. Show a person giving feedback using the 'I observed... It made me feel... One idea to improve is...' template. Include visual elements that represent the 'A TEA SHOPS' framework such as a book for Teacher, a beaker for Scientist, or a paintbrush for Artist. Use a warm, inviting color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the concept of giving powerful, constructive feedback in a friendly, empathetic setting, emphasizing the transformative impact of effective feedback on individuals and teams. In line with LinkedIn's professional, business-focused design, ensure the image exudes a sense of professional authority and thought leadership, suitable for B2B audiences and professional networking."
