"A professional, realistic illustration of a tea shop setting, showing different customers representing the "A Tea Shops" framework (Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, Student) engaged in actions that represent their key strengths. Include a notepad or a chalkboard showing the feedback template (I observed..., It made me feel..., One idea to improve is...) as a central element. Use earthy, calming colors to represent the tea shop environment with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the concept of giving and receiving feedback in a positive, constructive manner, symbolizing personal and professional growth, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."
