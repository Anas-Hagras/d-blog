In today's fast-paced world, mastering the art of giving and receiving feedback is crucial. When feedback is delivered thoughtfully, it transforms challenges into growth opportunities. Here's a simple framework to enhance your feedback skills:

1. **Observe** the behavior.
2. **Express** how it made you feel.
3. **Suggest** an improvement.

This approach ensures feedback is fact-based and constructive. Additionally, the "A TEA SHOPS" framework helps identify and nurture strengths, from being an Athlete who values health to a Student who embraces learning.
