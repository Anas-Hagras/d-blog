In both professional and personal realms, feedback is a powerful tool for growth. By investing time in delivering thoughtful feedback, we not only uplift others but also enhance our own environments. Here’s a valuable approach: use a structured template to ensure feedback is fact-based, empathetic, and actionable. Additionally, consider the "A Tea Shops" framework to identify and nurture strengths—think like an Athlete, Teacher, or Pioneer.
