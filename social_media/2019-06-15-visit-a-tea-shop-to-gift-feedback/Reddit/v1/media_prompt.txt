"A professional, realistic visual of an individual in a tea shop, representing the different personas from the 'A Tea Shops' strength framework. Each persona - Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, and Student - should be symbolically represented by relevant objects or scenarios within the tea shop setting. For instance, an engineering tool could represent the Engineer persona, or a book could represent the Teacher persona. Include a notepad and pen to represent the feedback template, emphasizing the act of writing down observations, feelings, and suggestions for improvement. Use a color scheme that represents a warm and inviting atmosphere with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of strengthening relationships through effective feedback, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."
