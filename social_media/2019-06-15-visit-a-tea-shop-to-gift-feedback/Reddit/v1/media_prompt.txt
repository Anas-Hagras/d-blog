**MEDIA PROMPT:**

"Create a professional, realistic image showing a tea shop scene where different personas are engaged in various activities that represent their roles. The tea shop should include 9 distinct sections, each occupied by a persona from the 'A tea shops' strength framework: an Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, and Student. 

In the Athlete section, show healthy foods and athletic equipment. In the Teacher section, show a character helping others. In the Engineer section, illustrate technical tools and pragmatic solutions. In the Artist section, visualize creativity and innovative thinking. In the Scientist section, emphasize data analysis and experimentation. In the Human section, convey authenticity and humor. In the Owner section, depict responsibility and accountability. In the Pioneer section, demonstrate courage and new initiatives. In the Student section, portray a learning environment and feedback mechanism. 

Use a warm, inviting color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the concept of giving and receiving effective feedback and the importance of different strengths in a team. The visual should represent the main themes from the blog post and align with the social media content's messaging, making it look authentic and valuable for social media."
