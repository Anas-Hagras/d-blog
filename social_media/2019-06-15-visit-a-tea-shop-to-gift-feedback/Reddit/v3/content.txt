**Title:** How to Give Effective Feedback: A Practical Template and Framework

In both personal and professional settings, providing constructive feedback can significantly benefit those around you, and in turn, yourself. Here are some essential guidelines and tools to improve your feedback skills.

### Key Principles for Giving Good Feedback:
- **Feedback is universal:** It can be directed to anyone, from colleagues to family members.
- **Preparation is key:** Deliver feedback verbally after planning it carefully.
- **Be strength-based, fact-based, and empathetic.**
- **View feedback as a gift:** It's an opportunity for growth and improvement.
- **Timeliness matters:** Provide feedback promptly when necessary, and establish regular feedback schedules (e.g., every two weeks).

### Feedback Preparation Template:
Use this simple, effective framework to prepare your feedback:

1. **I observed** [specific behavior].
2. **It made me feel** [your emotional response].
3. **One idea to improve is** [suggested action].

> Example: 
> 1. *I observed that* you arrived 10 minutes late to our meeting on Wednesday.
> 2. *It made me feel* that my time is less valuable than yours.
> 3. *One idea to improve is* to add a buffer between your meetings.
