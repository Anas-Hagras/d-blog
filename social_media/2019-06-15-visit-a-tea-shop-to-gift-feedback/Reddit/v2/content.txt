- **Strength-based and Empathetic**: Good feedback focuses on strengths, is fact-based, and is delivered with empathy.

- **Feedback as a Gift**: Receiving feedback is an opportunity for improvement.

- **Timeliness**: Provide feedback promptly when necessary, and schedule it regularly otherwise (e.g., every two weeks).
