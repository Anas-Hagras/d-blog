Giving great feedback is more than just a skill—it's a superpower! Whether you're at work or home, investing time in thoughtful feedback can create a ripple effect of growth. Here's how you can become a feedback guru:

💡 **Template for Success:** Start with a simple formula to prepare your feedback. Remember: "I observed ___. It made me feel ___. One idea to improve is ___." This ensures your feedback is fact-based and constructive.

🧠 **Think 'A Tea Shops':** Use this memorable framework to consider strengths. Aim to be an Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, or Student. These personas remind us of diverse strengths we can nurture in others. 

🎁 **Feedback is a Gift:** Approach it as an opportunity, not a criticism. When given promptly and empathetically, feedback can empower growth and foster trust.
