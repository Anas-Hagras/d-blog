**MEDIA PROMPT:**
"A professional, engaging image showing a diverse group of people having a feedback session in a tea shop setting. The individuals should represent different personas from the 'A Tea Shops' framework, such as an Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, and Student. Each persona should be depicted with subtle visual cues that represent their unique strengths. Include a notepad with the feedback template ('I observed...', 'It made me feel...', 'One idea to improve is...') written on it, symbolizing the preparation for giving feedback. Use vibrant but professional colors with a clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the power of constructive feedback and the unique strengths each persona can bring to the table, in a way that looks authentic, inspiring, and valuable for social media."
