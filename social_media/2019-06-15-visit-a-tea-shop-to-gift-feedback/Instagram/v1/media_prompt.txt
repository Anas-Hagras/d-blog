"A professional, realistic illustration of a tea shop where each letter in "A TEA SHOPS" represents a different persona (Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, Student). Each persona should be creatively represented with relevant symbols or elements (e.g., a dumbbell for Athlete, a book for Teacher, gears for Engineer, a paintbrush for Artist, etc.). Include a person thoughtfully taking a sip from a tea cup, symbolizing the act of giving feedback. Use a warm, inviting color scheme that includes shades of teal, representing communication and clarity. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of applying the 'A TEA SHOPS' framework for effective feedback as described in the social media content, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."
