🗣️ Ever wondered how giving feedback can actually strengthen your relationships? 🤔 Let's dive into the art of impactful feedback! 🌟

Feedback is like a gift 🎁—when done right, it can transform the people around you, both at work and in personal life. Here's how you can master it:

1️⃣ **Verbal First, Written Later**: Always prepare your feedback verbally before jotting it down. This ensures clarity and sincerity. ✍️

2️⃣ **Be Strength-Based & Empathetic**: Highlight strengths and approach with empathy. Remember, it's about growth, not criticism. 💪💖

3️⃣ **Timing is Everything**: Deliver feedback promptly when urgent, or schedule it regularly. Consistency is key! ⏰

To make it memorable, use the "A Tea Shops" framework: Be an Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, or Student. Each persona offers unique strengths to inspire your feedback approach. 🌈
