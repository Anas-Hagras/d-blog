🌟 Want to make your feedback truly transformative? 🌟

Giving effective feedback is an art and a science, and I've got some insights to share that will make it feel less daunting and more rewarding. 🤝 Here’s how you can turn feedback into a gift that empowers those around you:

1. **Prepare, Don’t Improvise**: Good feedback is best delivered verbally, but never without preparation. Jot it down first to ensure it’s fact-based and empathetic. 📝

2. **Use the Simple Template**: Try the "I observed… It made me feel… One idea to improve is…" formula. This keeps your feedback clear and constructive, steering clear of labels. 💡

3. **Embrace Strengths**: Consider the "A Tea Shops" framework to recognize diverse strengths in others—from Athletes to Artists, and Scientists to Students. This approach helps you be more systematic and comprehensive. 💪🎨🔬

Feedback isn't just a critique; it's a chance to build and grow together. What’s your go-to strategy for giving feedback that resonates? Share your thoughts below! 👇
