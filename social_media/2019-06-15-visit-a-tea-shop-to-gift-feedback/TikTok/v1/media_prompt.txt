"A professional, realistic illustration of a tea shop setting showing diverse characters embodying the nine personas (Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, Student) from the "A tea shops" strength framework. Each character should be engaged in an activity that represents their specific trait. For example, the Engineer could be fixing a tea machine, the Artist could be creating a chalkboard sign for the shop, and the Scientist could be carefully measuring tea leaves. Include a dialogue bubble over the Teacher character, symbolizing the act of giving feedback to others. Use a vibrant yet professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the concept of feedback as a secret superpower in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."
