SUBJECT: Master the Art of Giving Feedback with Our Simple Guide

Giving feedback, whether at work or in personal relationships, can be a powerful tool for growth. When those around us thrive, we all benefit. Hereâ€™s a quick guide to help you master this skill with ease.

- **Five Key Principles**: Feedback isn't just for subordinates; it can be shared with anyone. Prepare ahead, be empathetic and fact-based, and remember feedback is a gift. Deliver it promptly or schedule it regularly.

- **Feedback Template**: Jot down your thoughts using this simple framework:
  1. I observed *[specific behavior]*.
  2. It made me feel *[your reaction]*.
  3. One idea to improve is *[suggestion]*.

- **Strength Framework**: Use the "a tea shops" acronym to think about strengths:
  - *A*thlete: Prioritizes health and balance
  - *T*eacher: Mentors and shares knowledge
  - *E*ngineer: Provides practical solutions
  - *A*rtist: Embraces creativity
  - *S*cientist: Bases decisions on data
  - *H*uman: Shows authentic personality
  - *O*wner: Takes accountability
  - *P*ioneer: Leads with courage
  - *S*tudent: Welcomes growth

- **Real-Life Example**: I once reminded a superior to be more like a scientist by addressing selection bias and ensuring balanced scenario presentations.

Remember, feedback is about empowering others and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Try using these tools and watch the positive impact unfold!
