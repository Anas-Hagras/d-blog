SUBJECT: Transform Your Feedback Skills with Our Latest Guide

Giving good feedback is more than just a skillâ€”it's an investment that pays dividends in both your personal and professional life. By empowering those around you, you not only contribute to their growth but also enhance your environment. Our latest blog post provides you with two powerful tools to elevate your feedback game: 

1. A simple yet effective feedback template 
2. A memorable framework of desirable traits 

Here are five guiding principles to keep in mind for delivering constructive feedback:

- Feedback can be shared with anyone, from colleagues to family.
- Always start with verbal feedback, prepared in advance.
- Focus on strengths and facts, while staying empathetic.
- Remember, receiving feedback is a growth opportunity.
- Be timely with urgent feedback and schedule regular sessions.

To prepare your feedback, try using this straightforward template:

1. I observed ___. 
2. It made me feel ___. 
3. One idea to improve is ___.

Additionally, consider the "a tea shops" framework to identify strengths. This approach uses personas to categorize traits:

1. Athlete
2. Teacher
3. Engineer
4. Artist
5. Scientist
6. Human
7. Owner
8. Pioneer
9. Student

Each persona represents different strengths, from the creative thinking of an Artist to the accountability of an Owner.

For example, when I needed to address feedback with a former boss, I used the Scientist persona to encourage a fact-based approach.
