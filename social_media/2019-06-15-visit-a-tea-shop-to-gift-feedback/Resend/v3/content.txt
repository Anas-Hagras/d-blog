SUBJECT: Master the Art of Giving and Receiving Feedback

Feedback is more than just a conversationâ€”it's a powerful tool for growth, both personally and professionally. Investing time in giving meaningful, effective feedback can strengthen those around you and, in turn, benefit you.

Here's how to get started:

1. **Five Guiding Principles**
   - Feedback is universal and can be shared with anyone.
   - It should be verbal first, with careful preparation.
   - Focus on strengths and facts with empathy.
   - Treat feedback as a gift and an opportunity to improve.
   - Be timely, whether urgent or scheduled regularly.

2. **Feedback Template**
   Use this simple, memorable template:
   1. I observed...
   2. It made me feel...
   3. One idea to improve is...

3. **"A Tea Shops" Strength Framework**
   Enhance your feedback with a systematic approach:
   - **A**thlete: Healthy living
   - **T**eacher: Mentoring
   - **E**ngineer: Pragmatic solutions
   - **A**rtist: Creative thinking
   - **S**cientist: Data-driven decisions
   - **H**uman: Authentic self
   - **O**wner: Accountability
   - **P**ioneer: Courageous action
   - **S**tudent: Growth mindset

Putting it all together allows you to provide feedback that not only addresses specific situations but also encourages development through recognized strengths.
