SUBJECT: Unlock the Power of Effective Feedback

Hello,

Giving good feedback is like planting seeds for growth, both in your professional and personal life. Imagine everyone around you becoming stronger and more capableâ€”how wonderful would that be? Here's how you can make it happen with two simple tools: a feedback template and a framework of desirable traits.

Here are five guiding principles for good feedback:

1. Feedback can be given to anyone: colleagues, superiors, family, and more.
2. Prepare ahead of time and deliver feedback verbally first.
3. Make it strength-based, fact-based, and empathetic.
4. Consider feedback as a gift, an opportunity for improvement.
5. Provide feedback promptly when urgent, or schedule it regularly.

**The Feedback Template:**

1. I observed *___*.
2. It made me feel *___*.
3. One idea to improve is *___*.

This template helps keep your feedback clear and factual. 

**The "A Tea Shops" Framework:**

When identifying strengths, think of these nine personas:

- *Athlete*: Values health and balance
- *Teacher*: Empathically mentors others
- *Engineer*: Finds pragmatic solutions
- *Artist*: Applies creative thinking
- *Scientist*: Conducts unbiased experiments
- *Human*: Embraces authenticity
- *Owner*: Holds accountability
- *Pioneer*: Acts with courage
- *Student*: Welcomes growth

**Example of Applying Feedback:**

I once gave feedback to a superior using this structure: 

"I observed that you presented only the most optimistic scenarios. This made me feel concerned about selection bias. One idea to improve is to include all scenarios, noting the optimistic ones specifically."

By using this method, you encourage transparency and trust.

Take the first step to enriching your relationships and environments with these tools, and see the positive impact unfold. 

Feel free to share your thoughts and feedback with us!

Warm regards,
