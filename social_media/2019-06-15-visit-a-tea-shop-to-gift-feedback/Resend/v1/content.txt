SUBJECT: Master the Art of Giving and Receiving Feedback

Have you ever stopped to think about how powerful good feedback can be? Whether at work or in your personal life, providing effective feedback is a skill that can benefit everyone around you—and in turn, yourself. Let's dive into a few key principles and tools to enhance this skill.
