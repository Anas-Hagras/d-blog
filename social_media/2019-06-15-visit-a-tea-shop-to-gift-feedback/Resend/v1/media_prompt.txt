"A professional, realistic image of a tea shop where each element or person in the shop represents one of the nine strengths from the 'a tea shops' framework: Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, Student. Each character should be engaged in an activity that represents their respective strength. For example, the Athlete might be seen exercising, the Teacher could be seen guiding a customer, and the Scientist could be seen experimenting with different tea blends. The setting should be warm and inviting, symbolizing the nurturing atmosphere of giving and receiving feedback. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of mastering the art of giving and receiving feedback in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."
